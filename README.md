Play with Spring Boot
=====================

Spring Boot is something really exciting, every Java geek should have hear about it !  

Let's play with it, with easy understandable examples :)  

For spelling, sorry, I'm French...  

# Wiki

First, we need an IDE (ok it's not a requirement but we don't want to have an headache...) and setup few little things: [here is the wiki](../../wiki).

# Projects

## `hello-world-jersey-minimum` and `hello-world-sb-jersey-minimum`

[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) MVP !  
These 2 projects have the minimum to expose a REST service with Jersey and Spring.  

Difference between them ? Spring Boot of course !

`hello-world-sb-jersey-minimum` is simply the Spring Boot version of `hello-world-jersey-minimum`.  

For both, I followed Servlet 3.0 spec, thanks to [this Xebia tuto](http://blog.xebia.fr/2014/04/22/construire-une-api-rest-avec-jersey-et-spring-sans-web-xml-ni-applicationcontext-xml-ni-getterssetters/).
